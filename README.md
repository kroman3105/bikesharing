# Bike-Sharing in Des Moines

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use data gathered from a NYC bike-sharing program to gather key information to answer questions investors might have about potentially bringing a program to Des Moines.  We used our skills in Tableau to create visually appealing graphics and charts to help answer these questions.

## Analysis
The below seven visuals were created from the NYC bike-sharing data:

Subscribers make up more than 75% of total usage, indicating a large percentage of customers who find enough value in this service to use it repeatedly

Males make up the majority of the cliental

The overwhelming majority of trips are under an hour, with the majority being around 5 minutes

There is little to no disparity in the usage time between men and women

Peek hours appear to be in line with travel to and from work (7am - 9am and 5pm - 7pm).  This would indicate that the majority of the majority of the usage is to get to and from the a clients job.

Similar to duration, there allso is little to no disparity in peek usage between men and women

There are higher usage rates by subcribers on weekdays, while customers show higher usage rates on weekends suggesting out of town vacationers use the bike primarily on weekends

## Conclusion

The high number of subscribers of this service in NYC shows that there is clearly an ongoing demand for bike-sharing and it does not appear to be a novelty activity that individuals just try out once.  Since the peak usage rates appear to be sorrounding transportation to and from work, this service also appears to be meeting daily transportation needs among its cliental.  As we continue to perform our analysis, I think there are two additional visuals that we could create that would further provide insight.  First showing a map of the most active starting station locations and surrounding ammenities would help better understand where to place stations in Des Moines to get the most usage.  For example, if we see bikes commonly used near large apartment complexes, we may look to position the Des Moines stations near large apartment complexes.  Additionally, since there are fewer women who appear to be using the service, I would want to pull some visuals that would really help us target that demographic for growth.  A starting visual for this could be created to show the average age of women using the service.  If we can further narrow in on this demographic, we can better focus our advertising campaigns and be strategic about station locations.
